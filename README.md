# PDBfile_toolkits
A summary of useful scripts to deal with PDB files

## MATLAB
1. split a N-model pdb file (e.g. pdb structures derived from NMR data) into N single-model pdb files 
2. rename a chain (i.e. if two single-chain proteins are aligned, to prevent both chains are called chain A, we can
rename one chain before alignment)
3. conversion between PDB files and coordinates

## PyMol
1. insert a psuedo atom in PyMol 
2. align a pdb file to another
